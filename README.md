# Perfume-Bottle-Design-in-Blender-with-Three-Style-Lighting-Effect

Design

First I simply used shapes to design the perfume bottle, adjusting its size, position and rotation.For this I used one cube for body of bottle, three cylinders for neck, sprayer and cap and one plane for adding a text box on the bottle.

The next part was to add textures to the perfume bottle, which I did using the shading panel by adding nodes. Unlike Adobe softwares that I mostly use, node based method is quite different but its really fun to use. In these images, you can clearly see the texture of the bottle that I added using noise texture normal map along with metal neck and sprayer and glass lid. Then, I added text and gave it a metal look using material panel.

In the last part, Its clearly visible that there is no background lighting because here I used area light to give a minimal style look to the perfume bottle.
